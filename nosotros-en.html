      <h2>A bit of history</h2>
      <div class="historia">
        <p>
          The idea of creating <strong>Foodify</strong> was born in 2020 during a family meal in
          the small kitchen of our founders, Marta and Andrés. Both passionate
          about gastronomy and with an inexhaustible entrepreneurial spirit,
          they began dreaming of the possibility of taking fast food to a new
          level: quality and speed accessible to everyone, in the comfort of
          their homes.
        </p>
        <p>
          With humble beginnings but a clear vision, Marta and Andrés decided to
          join forces to create a business that not only offered delicious
          dishes but also ensured fast and efficient service. Thus, in 2021,
          they opened their first kitchen in a small venue in the heart of
          Etxebarri, with a carefully crafted menu that combined the best of
          traditional and modern cuisine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to the dedication and effort of the team, the company quickly
          gained popularity. Orders increased, and the satisfaction of our
          customers became our greatest ally. Within a few months, <strong>Foodify</strong>
          became the benchmark for home-delivered fast food in the region.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, with success firmly established, we expanded our operations
          and opened several branches in different cities. Today, <strong>Foodify</strong>
          has a committed and passionate team, always ready to exceed our
          customers' expectations, providing a unique and memorable culinary
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <strong>Foodify</strong>, we believe that good food can brighten anyone's day.
          That's why every dish we prepare is made not only with the best
          ingredients but also with the love and dedication that define us.
          Thank you for allowing us to be part of your special moments!
